    The main purpose of this extension is to provide helper utilities for, and somewhat automate the Best Buy queue process when attempting to purchase popular items.
    While this extension will assist with automatically clickign add-to-cart buttons and playing notification sounds, it <b>does not provide any auto-checkout features whatsoever.</b>
</p>
<p>I wish everyone the best of luck purchasing whatever's popular right now - feel free to contact me with any bugs or feature suggestions and I would be happy to listen.</p>

<!-- Instructions for usage, TODO refine -->
<p class="page-subheader">Usage Instructions</p>
<p class="bulletpoint">• <b>Save items for later</b> through Best Buy using the blue bookmark icon
<p class="bulletpoint">• Navigate to Best Buy's <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/cart">cart page</a> showing the saved items (which provides a more convenient interface than the normal saved items page)</p>
<p class="bulletpoint">• <b>Configure the whitelist and blacklist keywords within the extension settings</b> (saved item must both contain at least one whitelisted keyword and no blacklisted keywords to qualify)</p>
<p class="bulletpoint">• When the item comes into stock, the script will automatically click the add-to-cart button, either directly adding the item to cart or joining the queue</p>
<p class="bulletpoint">• If the item gets entered into a queue, the script will automatically press the add-to-cart button when the queue elapses - <b>regardless, a notification sound will play whenever any item is added to the cart</b></p>
