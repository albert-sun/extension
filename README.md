# extension
Chrome extension for performing various partially-automated utilities for websites like Best Buy (and currently planned, EVGA for B-Stock). Inspired by my predecessor [Tampermonkey script](https://github.com/albert-sun/tamper-scripts) though it completely ditches the document interaction and watching functionality.
